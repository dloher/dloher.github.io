{%marginfigure 'profile' 'assets/img/profile.png' 'As a social anthropologist, I am an expert in "deep hanging out" (Rosaldo). Curious to know more about the social world, I consider iterative research designs as a productive way to leave space for the unexpected.
<br>Others call it the principle of serendipity.'%}

{%newthought 'I am'%} a social anthropologist and a specialist in higher education development based in Switzerland. As an anthropologist, I am interested in questions at the intersections of legal anthropology, environmental anthropology, and the anthropology of the state. As a higher education development specialist, I am working on questions of public education. Intrigued by the idea of the university not only as a space for individual learning, but as a public and cultural institution, I am interested in creating learning environments that foster critical thinking and collaboration, and hold dear the idea of human freedom as a basic idea of pedagogy.

{%newthought 'I received'%} received my PhD in social anthropology from the [University of Bern](https://www.anthro.unibe.ch){:target='blank'} in 2016 with a research on so-called assisted voluntary return migration, tracing the transnational migration trajectories of Tunisian migrants between Tunisia and Switzerland. In my following project as a Post-doc researcher, I was working on the legacy of the asbestos industry in Northern Italy. Since 2021, I am a higher education development specialist at the [Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and the Arts HSLU](https://www.hslu.ch/zllf){:target='blank'}.

{%newthought 'In addition'%} to my expertise in ethnographic research methods, mixed methods research designs, and my knowledge in anthropological theories, I have extensive teaching experience at universities and universities of applied sciences, and a background as an elementary school teacher.
