<p><em>Before I was an academic, I was a teacher. Between 1996 and 2002, I studied at the University of Teacher Education in Rorschach. In 2003, a year after my graduation with a teaching diploma for elementary schools, I started my B.A. studies in social anthropology (major) and philosophy (minor) at the University of Bern. In 2007, I began my M.A. studies in social anthropology (major) and philosophy (minor) with an Erasmus study year at the Humboldt University Berlin and took additional courses in philosophy at the Freie Universität Berlin. In 2013 and 2014, during my fieldwork in Tunisia for my PhD studies (2012 - 2016), I was an affiliated researcher at the IRMC (Institut de Recherche sur le Maghreb Contemporain) in Tunis.</em></p>
