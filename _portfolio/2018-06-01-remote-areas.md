{%newthought 'This photographic' %} long-term project documents the retreat of human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries have transformed these remote areas.

{%newthought 'Forestry,'%} hydropower, and quarries are characterstic for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century---in particular after World War II and until the late 1980s---large industrial steelwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandoned the remote hamlets, and the forest reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.

{%newthought 'Simultaneously,'%} the vacated spaces allow for new experimental forms of exploitation and cohabitation. This re-appropriation by newcomers has quite a long tradition in many remote areas of the Alps and typically occurs in cycles.
