      <h1>Transformation of Remote Rural Areas in the Alps</h1>

<p><span class="newthought">This photographic</span> long-term project documents the retreat of human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries have transformed these remote areas.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Forestry,</span> hydropower, and quarries are characterstic for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century—in particular after World War II and until the late 1980s—large industrial steelwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandoned the remote hamlets, and the forest reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.</p>

<figure><figcaption><span>In Villadossola, the steel mill SISMA employed up to 1.600 workers in its heydays after World War II. The company went bankrupt in 2014 following a long structural crisis of the Italian steel industry and a series of unsuccessful restructuring measures. <br /><em>Source: <a href="https://archiviodelverbanocusioossola.com">www.archiviodelverbanocusioossola.com</a></em> <br />(cc-by-nc-nd 4.0)</span></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/sisma.jpg" /></figure>

<p><span class="newthought">Simultaneously,</span> the vacated spaces allow for new experimental forms of exploitation and cohabitation. This re-appropriation by newcomers has quite a long tradition in many remote areas of the Alps and typically occurs in cycles.</p>
