<p class="subtitle">October 2012</p>

<p>Europe’s borders and border control practices have undergone a profound change in recent years.

Since 1985, the Schengen/ Dublin Agreements have become the main pillar of the European asylum and migration policy.

Although not part of the EU, Switzerland is engaged in many of these organizations. This emerging European border regime has led to new forms of border control practices, aiming at the effective control or “management” of undocumented migration. These border control practices are no longer restricted to the proper geo-politcal border, but relocated and deterritorialised. Nonetheless, undocumented migration towards Europe persists: Migrants as mobile subjects continue to cross EU’s external borders.</p>

<p>In this context, my PhD project took Switzerland’s programmme of so-called assisted voluntary return migration (AVR) for Tunisian migrants as a case study to examine the contradictions of the modern liberal nation state that emerge in the governance of transnational mobility.</p>
